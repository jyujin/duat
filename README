# DUAT-7 #######################################################################

Duat is an asynchronous 9P2000(.u) I/O library based on Curie -
http://ef.gy/documentation/curie - which tries to stay as close to the protocol
as possible without needlessly complicating things for users of the library.
The library is written in the Curie dialect of C and has a very small disk and
memory footprint.

NOTE:
Please take note of the library licence (the COPYING file), as well as the
credits (the CREDITS file).

# DETAILS ######################################################################

## Getting the source code: ####################################################

Duat is available under a very permissive MIT/X-style licence. The master
source repository is at http://git.becquerel.org/kyuba/duat.git - a public
GitHub mirror is at https://github.com/kyuba/duat

Recent releases are posted on GitHub at https://github.com/kyuba/duat/releases
and, while canonical tarballs are no longer provided for the library, release
tarballs (and ZIP files) are available in the git frontends.

Note that, instead of following the next two sections, you may also just check
out the duat repository as a subdirectory of your Curie sources and compile the
library as part of Curie. More details on that are in Curie's README.

## Compilation: ################################################################

Make sure you have libcurie-12 or higher installed, then:

    $ make PREFIX=/usr

## Installation: ###############################################################

Use this command to install the library (for example into /usr with the PREFIX=
parameter):

    $ make PREFIX=/usr install

## Documentation: ##############################################################

Duat uses Doxygen for documentation. To compile the documentation, issue this
command on a shell:

    $ doxygen doxyfile

After the command has run you can find the generated documentation in the
documentation/html directory. The documentation for the current git version is
available at: http://ef.gy/documentation/duat

# CONTACT: #####################################################################

Your best bet to get help with the library is by hopping onto the freenode IRC
server and joining the \#kyuba channel.

Alternatively, you could email the lead developer at: magnus@ef.gy

Check out the blog at http://ef.gy/ while you're at it - who knows, it might
be fun ;D.
