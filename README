# DUAT-7 #######################################################################

Duat is an asynchronous 9P2000(.u) I/O library based on Curie -
http://ef.gy/documentation/curie - which tries to stay as close to the protocol
as possible without needlessly complicating things for users of the library.
The library is written in the Curie dialect of C and has a very small disk and
memory footprint.

NOTE:
Please take note of the library licence (the COPYING file), as well as the
credits (the CREDITS file).

# DETAILS ######################################################################

## Getting the source code: ####################################################

Duat is available under a very permissive MIT/X-style licence. The master
source repository is at http://git.becquerel.org/kyuba/duat.git - a public
GitHub mirror is at https://github.com/jyujin/duat

Recent releases are posted on GitHub at https://github.com/jyujin/duat/releases
and, while canonical tarballs are no longer provided for the library, release
tarballs (and ZIP files) are available in the git frontends.

## Compilation: ################################################################

Make sure you have libcurie-12 or higher installed, then:

    $ make PREFIX=/usr

NOTE: As of the time of this writing, Curie-12 has not been released yet; to
compile Duat you would thus need the current Git version of Curie. Once Curie-12
comes out you should be able to use that version instead if you're not too keen
on using sources straight out of version control.

## Installation: ###############################################################

Use this command to install the library (for example into /usr with the PREFIX=
parameter):

    $ make PREFIX=/usr install

# CONTACT: #####################################################################

Your best bet to get help with the library is by hopping onto the freenode IRC
server and joining the \#kyuba channel.

Alternatively, you could email the lead developer at: magnus@ef.gy

Check out the blog at http://ef.gy/ while you're at it - who knows, it might
be fun ;D.
